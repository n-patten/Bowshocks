We present reduced and normalized spectra of previously unclassified late-O and early-B type stars (effective temperatures ranging from 10000-50000 K) that power bowshock nebulae.

Metal resonance lines measured from ultraviolet spectroscopy serve as a good tool to measure mass-loss rates for massive stars with strong winds, and agree with theoretical predictions. However, in the limit of weak winds, UV-derived mass-loss rates differ from predictions by as much as two orders of magnitude, known as the "weak-wind problem." Using infrared bowshock data from the GAIA DR3 release, we propose a new method of measuring mass-loss rates for massive stars with weak winds by the principle of balancing the momentum flux between the stellar wind and the interstellar material. From a list of stars powering bowshocks, we limit our search to massive stars with weak winds to implement our new method of calculating mass-loss rates to bridge the discrepancy between theoretically and observationally derived mass-loss rates.

The spectra were obtained from Apache Point Observatory (APO) 3.5m telescope using the KOSMOS optical long-slit spectrograph. We use the 0.83" low slit with a wavelength coverage of 3800-6200 Angstroms. The KOSMOS spectrograph has an approximate resolution of 2600. The reduced spectra were then compared with solar metallicity model spectra from Granda HRES Library of template spectra to determine fundamental stellar parameters, temperature and surface gravity, using temperature sensitive and gravity sensitive line ratios.

These fundamental stellar parameters will then be used in conjunction with GAIA proper motions and velocities to measure the mass-loss rate of these weak-wind, massive stars.
